AB This paper introduces a dataset for event extraction in the field of investment research. Event extraction is a key area of research in the field of investment. In recent years, a large number of datasets for common event extraction as well as financial event extraction have been released. However, they only cover few event types compared with real-world business scenarios. Hence, by combining actual requirements of financial investment risk management with business needs and experience in terms of investment, we construct a dataset for financial event extraction. The released dataset is the first fine-grained dataset for event extraction in investment research areas, with 5 main categories and 59 event types totally. The dataset is available on http://openkg.cn/dataset/iree.
